One of the many great things about working at The Network is that development teams are encouraged to make use of and contribute back to open source software initiatives. We were recently working on a product feature to enable clients to import HTML content in HTML: a Word document-to-HTML importer. To accomplish this we evaluated some commercial libraries but it looked like the Word Document analysis capability was niche enough to encourage those commercial offerings to enforce egregious licensing costs and agreements.
