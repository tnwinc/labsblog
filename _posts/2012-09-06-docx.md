One of the many great things about working at The Network is that development teams are encouraged to make use of and contribute back to open source software initiatives. We recently completed a product feature to enable clients to import HTML content in HTML: a Word document-to-HTML importer. To accomplish this we evaluated some commercial libraries but it looked like the Word Document processing capability was niche enough to encourage those commercial offerings to enforce egregious licensing costs and agreements.

After investigating Word Document processing alternatives in the open-source space, we chose [DocX](http://docx.codeplex.com/) because it had a small but active group of contributors, a founder who was genuinely enthusiastic about our efforts to contribute to the project, and an easy to use API with enough base features to get us going.
