summary: When you don't feel like programming, program something fun!

After returning to work after my father passed away, I found it really difficult to focus on my work. I felt like I just
didn't want to program. I would try to think about the problem set at hand, but my mind would end up wandering. I knew that
if I could just capture my muse, I could get back into the groove.

That's when I decided to implement [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) in HTML and
Javascript. The focus for me, I decided, was to have fun. I wasn't going to worry about coding style, TDD, scalability,
browser compatability, etc. unless I decided it would be fun at the time. It was, for sure, a very pleasing and rewarding
experience. It definitly captured my muse!

On the way home that evening, I was going back and forth with my brother on ideas to expand upon the game. I could introduce
multiple races, which would interact differently, I could use canvas and web workers (which I had never taken the chance
to do before). Of course, by the time we got home, the conversation had devolved into, and I was excited to get started on, 
Humans and Zombies!

Over that evening and the 4th of July, I had the most wonderful time programming. I've had far more fun creating
this simple Human vs. Zombies game than I have ever had playing any game. Even Minecraft! Each time I finished adding something,
another idea would come up. "Ok, humans and zombies can now travel around... What about colonies? Humans like to stick
together. WOAH!"

The results of this fun experiment are now posted up on Github, and you can go play the game right now!
