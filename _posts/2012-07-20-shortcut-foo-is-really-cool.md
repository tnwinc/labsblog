[shortcutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/) is a really cool site that
helps you practice using the keyboard shortcuts for your editor of
choice.

Of course, I use Vim, so keyboard shortcuts are extremely important. But
the site also has drills for those less fortunate among us that are
stuck using TextMate, Visual Studio, Xcode... even Sublime!

Seriously though, I recommend it. It is a pay service, but its just
$4.99 one-time. You can try it out for free.

BTW, this post took 3.45 seconds less time than average to write.
