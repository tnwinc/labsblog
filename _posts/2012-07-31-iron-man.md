We have our very own [Iron Man][]!

This Iron Man:

![Steve White's Times][SteveTimes]

### 15 HOURS of straight activity
That's nearly two workdays in one day of CONSTANT movement.

### 1.5 HOURS of swimming
I get tired after about 30 minutes of playing with my kids in the pool.

### 112 MILES on a bicycle
Roughly the distance from [Atlanta, GA to Chattanooga, TN].

### 26.2 MILES running
Yeah, it's a marathon. You know, AFTER all the stuff above.

Kudos to Steve for the training, time and dedication that it took to finish and be a real life Iron Man!
