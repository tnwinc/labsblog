The Buford Highway Eater's Club does Korean bibimbap
====================================================

First, some background, for our faithful blog-readers:
------------------------------------------------------
Our corporate office in Norcross, Georgia, happens to be a few short miles west of Atlanta's legendary Buford Highway - a venerable cornucopia of international eateries. Expect anything from standing-room-only hole-in-the-wall joints to formal dining rooms, but do your research and know where you're going and what to order, and there's great eats to be had.

And reproduced here, my official invitation to our most recent outing:

>For those not already in the club --- here’s what it’s all about: you enjoy good >food? Great, me too, nice to meet you. You enjoy a little adventure? Of course you >do. Join the club and expect a memorable lunch, not far from the office, that I’ve >personally scouted, can vouch for, and even have a couple menu recommendations.

>Here’s what you need to know about bibimbap (say it slowly – “bib-em-bop”) – they take a bowl made of STONE, heat it up to SIX HUNDRED DEGREES, lightly oil it then add in steamed rice, top it with sautéed vegetables, the meats (beef or pork) or un-meats (marinated mushroom) of your choosing, then top with shredded lettuce a fried egg (over-easy), and some gochujang, which is like a spicy pepper sauce made by loving hands of Korean cherubs. 
>    Once brought to your table it’s stirred thoroughly: the lettuce wilts, the egg >cooks, and the rice crisps against the hot bowl. Several little dishes of other >items are brought to the table to round out the meal – kimchee, spicy pickled >cucumbers, sesame noodle, small radish cucumber salad, and potatoes in a sweet >sesame syrup, to be shared amongst your tablemates.
