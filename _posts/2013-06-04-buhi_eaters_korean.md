The Buford Highway Eater's Club does Korean bibimbap
====================================================

First, some background, for our faithful blog-readers:
------------------------------------------------------
Our corporate office in Norcross, Georgia, happens to be a few short miles west of Atlanta's legendary Buford Highway - a venerable cornucopia of international eateries. Expect anything from standing-room-only hole-in-the-wall joints to formal dining rooms, but do your research and know where you're going and what to order, and there's great eats to be had.

And reproduced here, my official invitation to our most recent outing:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
>It’s been a solid few months since the last Buford Highway Eaters Club outing. We’re down a few good eaters, and looking for some new recruits.

For those not already in the club --- here’s what it’s all about: you enjoy good food? Great, me too, nice to meet you. You enjoy a little adventure? Of course you do. Join the club and expect a memorable lunch, not far from the office, that I’ve personally scouted, can vouch for, and even have a couple menu recommendations.

 ### This time we’re eating: Korean bibimbap at Woo Nam Jeong Stone Bowl.

>Here’s what you need to know about bibimbap (say it slowly – “bib-em-bop”) – they take a bowl made of STONE, heat it up to SIX HUNDRED DEGREES, lightly oil it then add in steamed rice, top it with sautéed vegetables, the meats (beef or pork) or un-meats (marinated mushroom) of your choosing, then top with shredded lettuce a fried egg (over-easy), and some gochujang, which is like a spicy pepper sauce made by loving hands of Korean cherubs. 
>Once brought to your table it’s stirred thoroughly: the lettuce wilts, the egg cooks, and the rice crisps against the hot bowl. Several little dishes of other items are brought to the table to round out the meal – kimchee, spicy pickled cucumbers, sesame noodle, small radish cucumber salad, and potatoes in a sweet sesame syrup, to be shared amongst your tablemates.

>### Gee, I’m not sure… I like the chicken fried rice from the China Bucket Express up the road just fine.

What makes Woo Namg Jeong Stone Bowl so special? To begin with, have you ever eaten Korean food? Stone Bowl’s staff are helpful ambassadors to the stuff, and will help you along the way. The owner, an old lady everyone refers to as “grandma”, cooks with heart. (A sign on the front door showing their hours explains they’re closed Wednesdays because “grandma needs a rest”.)

>### I’m still not convinced. I mean, it’s not like they won an award or something.
Actually, they kind of did.

Stone Bowl’s mushroom bibimbap was rated one of Creative Loafing’s Top 100 Dishes in Atlanta, in 2011 and 2013:

I’m a meat person through-and-through, but after trying this mushroom variation, I am not looking back. 
####Read: this is THE dish to order here,
second only to a plate of bulgogi (specially marinated grilled beef) you might want to share with some friends.
