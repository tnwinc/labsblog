The Buford Highway Eater's Club does Korean bibimbap
====================================================

First, some background, for our faithful blog-readers:
------------------------------------------------------
Our corporate office in Norcross, Georgia, happens to be a few short miles west of Atlanta's legendary Buford Highway - a venerable cornucopia of international eateries. Expect anything from standing-room-only hole-in-the-wall joints to formal dining rooms, but do your research and know where you're going and what to order, and there's great eats to be had.

And reproduced here, my official invitation to our most recent outing:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s been a solid few months since the last Buford Highway Eaters Club outing. We’re down a few good eaters, and looking for some new recruits.
    For those not already in the club --- here’s what it’s all about: you enjoy good food? Great, me too, nice to meet you. You enjoy a little adventure? Of course you do. Join the club and expect a memorable lunch, not far from the office, that I’ve personally scouted, can vouch for, and even have a couple menu recommendations.
