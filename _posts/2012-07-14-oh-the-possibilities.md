I just read about Vim's client-server capabilities: [client-server](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/remote.html)

My mind is racing with ideas!

Maybe a Pusher-to-Vim bridge that will allow a Vim instance to receive
Pusher messages? What *couldn't* I do with that?

Improved integration with vim-spec-runner? It could automatically open
the correct files when specs fail.

Campfire integration? I could be notified every time someone mentions my
name.

So many possibilities!
